2. If you want to directly run the predictor, just run this [notebook](https://github.com/altruistcoder/Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/Digit_Recognition_Prediction.ipynb). This repository also consists of already trained weights in this [pickle file](https://github.com/altruistcoder/Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/mnist_clf_svm.pkl).
